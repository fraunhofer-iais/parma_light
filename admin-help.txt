=================================================

Options:
  -q         quiet mode, no startup message
Commands:
  --help     get help (this text).
  
  --init {parma-dir}
    creates a setup of the parma demonstrator in {parma-dir}. {parma-dir} must not exist,
    except, when '' or 'datastore_parma' is used. Then, it is assumed, that this a
    test and debug directory 'datastore_parma', contained in this repo (and in .gitignore)
  
  --backend
    starts the PARMA light backend server. Listens on port 8080. Run in a terminal of its own.

  --frontend
    starts the PARMA light frontend cli. Sends REST commands to port 8080. Run in a terminal of its own.
    Enter the command 'test_data;' to load some data.

  --image {domain} {name} {version}
    'domain' is the name of a directory in 'test/container', in which all container of a group are assembled
    'name' should be the name of an image to be build and the name of a directory in the 'domain' directory
    'docker build' is called.
    'version' is the version of the tag created (for demonstration purposes almost always "1").

  --images {domain}
    create all images for the 'domain' given. 'domain' is the name of a directory in 'test/container'.

  --dind-build
    build a docker images containing the parma_light backend.

  --dind-run -di {docker-image} -ds {absolute-path-to-datastore_parma} -log {absolute-path-to-log_file}
    run the docker image of the parma_light backend generated above.
    -di defines the (optional) name of the parma_light docker image, default is 'parma_light'
    -ds defines the (optional) ABSOLUTE path to the directory of the datastore on the local machine for the entity_store,
        the data_dir and the temp_dir. If you want to keep the datastore to survive a docker run, you MUST use this parameter.
    - log defines the (optional) absolute path to the log file on the local machine.
        If you want to keep the logging data to survive a docker run, you MUST use this parameter.

    If you get a permission error for docker.sock, run the command
      chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock
    This is a security problem. Use never in production systems! Read about 'dind' and the security implications.

    Notes:
    - you have to run the CLI (./admin.sh --frontend) to send your commands to the backend
    - the data store is initialized (and not persisted) everytime when the container is started
    If you want to use dind not only for demonstration purposes, contact reinhard.budde AT iais.fraunhofer.de

  --assess
    use uv to update the toml-file and uv.lock, then run
    - pip-audit to create the bill-of-materials checking vulnerabilities in file audit.json
    - pip-licences to create the bill-of-materials checking licenses of used packages
      in file licenses.md and licenses.json
