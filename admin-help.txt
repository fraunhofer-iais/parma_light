Commands:
  --help     get help (this text).
  
  --init {parma-dir}
    creates a setup of the parma demonstrator in {parma-dir}. {parma-dir} must not exist,
    except, when '' or 'datastore_parma' is used. Then, it is assumed, that this a
    test and debug directory 'datastore_parma', contained in this repo (and in .gitignore)
  
  --backend -c {path-to-toml-property-file}
    starts the PARMA light backend server. Listens on port 8080. Run it in a terminal of its own.
    -c  defines the path to the toml-property-file, default is "parma_light.toml"
    
    see --dood-run for running Parma Light in a docker container

  --frontend
    starts the PARMA light frontend cli. Sends REST commands to port 8080. Run in a terminal of its own.
    Enter the command 'test_data;' to load some data.

  --image {domain} {name} {version}
    'domain' is the name of a directory in 'test/container', in which all container of a group are assembled
    'name' should be the name of an image to be build and the name of a directory in the 'domain' directory
    'docker build' is called.
    'version' is the version of the tag created (for demonstration purposes almost always "1").

  --images {domain}
    create all images for the 'domain' given. 'domain' is the name of a directory in 'test/container'.

  --dood-build
    build a docker images containing the parma_light backend.

  --dood-run -di {docker-image} -c {path-to-toml-property-file} -log {absolute-path-to-log_file}
    run the docker image of the parma_light backend (typically generated by "dood-build" above).
    -di      defines the (optional) name of the parma_light docker image, default is 'parma_light'
    -c       defines the path to the toml-property-file, default is "parma_light_dood_{linux-or-windows}.toml",
             depending on the operationg system running on the host
    -debugpy run in debug mode. Port for connecting is 5678

    see --backend for running Parma Light locally

    Notes:
    - If you get a permission error for docker.sock, on linux systems run the command
        chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock
      This is a security problem. Use never in production systems! Read about 'dood' and 'dind' and the security implications.
    - you have to run the CLI (./admin.sh --frontend) to send your commands to the backend

  --assess
    use uv to update the toml-file and uv.lock, then run
    - pip-audit to create the bill-of-materials checking vulnerabilities in file audit.json
    - pip-licences to create the bill-of-materials checking licenses of used packages
      in file licenses.md and licenses.json

  --publish-new-version <version-for-parma-light-starting-with-v>
    create a new version of the parma_light docker image to docker hub. Pin this version in the git repo by a tag with same name
