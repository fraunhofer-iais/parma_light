# The Demonstrator Parma-Light

This git repository contains the implementation of the Parma-Light demonstrator:

- the rationale behind this repository is described in `resources/RATIONALE.md`
- the API, that can be used by either a CLI or a REST-server is described in `resources/APIDOC.md`

- the bash script `./admin.sh` contains commands to experiment with the demonstrator:
  - `./admin.sh init` to initialize the datastore
  - `./admin.sh init_data` to load some data for experiments
  - `./admin.sh run` to run the CLI of the demonstrator. Available commands are in `resources/APIDOC.md`

  - run `./admin.sh init init_data run` to have fully usable data for experiments

# Further Notes

The implementation is IP of the department AAA of the Fraunhofer Institute IAIS and the Fraunhofer Institute IAIS.
